Experience the classic Hide and Seek game in a new and innovative way! Use your phone to see your real-time location and view the game area, which gradually shrinks to challenge the hiders. Easily share the game with friends using a QR code, no servers required!

## How to Play
• Create or join a game: Host a new game or join an existing one using a QR code.
• Choose your role: Play as either a hider or a seeker.
• Hiders: Hide within the game area and move strategically as it shrinks. Avoid being found by seekers.
• Seekers: Find and catch all hiders before time runs out.
• Game information: Your phone will show information like your role, the game area, your location, and remaining game time.

## Game Customization
The application is designed to allow for high game customization, letting you easily save and share the games or "maps" you create.
• Creating a map: When creating a map, you can change the length of the game, define its central point and radius of the game area, customize the interval between each border reduction, the duration of the border reduction, and how much it will shrink.
• Hosting a map: When hosting a saved map, you can adjust the start time, giving the host time to share the game. You can also set the maximum time players can be outside the game area before being eliminated and decide if seekers can be eliminated for being outside it.
• Sharing a game: When sharing a game, you can assign a role to the player you are sharing with and choose among different permission levels to determine if and under what conditions players can share the game with others.
